# Credit Card Approval Prediction - Project Proposal

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a credit card application will be approved or rejected based on the applicant's information. The model will analyze various attributes of applicants to identify patterns that lead to approval or rejection, helping financial institutions automate their decision-making process and potentially reducing bias in credit approval.

## 2. Dataset Description

We will use the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about credit card applications with the following characteristics:

- **Number of Instances**: 690
- **Number of Attributes**: 15 + class attribute
- **Class Distribution**: 
  - Approved: 307 (44.5%)
  - Rejected: 383 (55.5%)
- **Missing Values**: 37 cases (5%) have one or more missing values

The dataset has a mix of continuous and categorical attributes, with all attribute names and values anonymized to protect confidentiality.

## 3. Project Objectives

1. Develop a robust machine learning model to predict credit card approval decisions
2. Achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall in predictions
3. Identify key factors that influence credit approval decisions
4. Create visualizations to interpret model results and dataset characteristics
5. Build a reusable and maintainable codebase for future enhancements

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques
- Encode categorical variables
- Normalize/standardize continuous features
- Split data into training and testing sets

### 4.2 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Analyze distributions of features
- Identify correlations between features
- Visualize class distributions
- Detect potential outliers

### 4.3 Model Development

We will implement and compare multiple classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

### 4.4 Model Evaluation

The models will be evaluated using:

- Accuracy
- Precision and Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

### 4.5 Feature Importance Analysis

- Identify which features have the most significant impact on approval decisions
- Visualize feature importance

## 5. Implementation Plan

The project will be implemented in Go (Golang), leveraging its performance benefits and concurrency capabilities. We'll use the following libraries:

- GoLearn for machine learning algorithms
- Gonum for numerical computations
- go-chart for data visualization
- gota for data manipulation
